Organize Spotify Song Lists by Genre

** = could technically outsource and do ahead of time and store in a file to call
-- = only if first
## = only do if not first time running

Sequence of Steps
1. Call Spotify API and Do All Necessary Authorization and Obtain Object(s) Needed for Further Steps
2. Get List of All Genre's That Are Available in Spotify **
3. Grab All Songs That User Has In Spotify Library and Store in Some Object 
4a. Iterate Through Songs and Query Spotify API to obtain Genre for all Songs and Store in Song: Genre format --
4b. Or could do my artists which may be easier for querying, storing, and efficiency --
4c. Grab Recently Added Songs and Check if Songs Have Been Added to "Database" and if so then songs are not recent and thus
    don't have to query for genre because more than likely, it should already be in a playlist for the User ##
5. Save Genres As We Are Iterating To Keep Track of What Genre(s) We May Need to Generate Playlists For
6. Check if Genre names Saved Above have already Had Playlists Created Or Not (If so .. step 8, if not .. step 7)
7. Create Playlist (or store to indicate playlist needs to be created prior to adding music)
8. At this point .. all genre playlists will have been created either previously or in the steps above
9. Iterate through all songs and Add to There Respective Playlists 
10. Done
